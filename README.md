# Pyramidal Horn Antenna Project
This repository contains the code and report for an end-semester project on the design and analysis of a Pyramidal Horn Antenna. The project focuses on the implementation of a horn antenna, its characterization, and the evaluation of its performance.


The Pyramidal Horn Antenna is a widely used antenna structure known for its directional radiation pattern and high gain. This project aims to explore the design considerations, simulation, and experimental verification of a pyramidal horn antenna operating at a specific frequency range.

# Results and Analysis
The results of the project, including simulation outputs, measurement data, and analysis, are presented in the report directory. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the design process, performance evaluation, and comparison with theoretical expectations.
